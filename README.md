A repository for the files for the Weekly Code Challenges taken part in during the [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/) course.

The challenges are intended to to help Launch School students practice and hone their coding and problem solving
skills learnt during the curriculum. Solutions are submitted and peer-reviewed and the problem is discussed by an instructor during a weekly live session.

The 3 skills that we are encouraged to develop in undertaking the weekly challenges are:

1. problem solving with code
2. refactoring
3. reading code

> *Repetition and practice is key to the path to proficiency*
