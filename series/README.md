### Series

---

Write a program that will take a string of digits and give you all the possible consecutive number series of length n in that string.

For example, the string "01234" has the following 3-digit series:

```ruby
- 012
- 123
- 234
```
And the following 4-digit series:

```ruby
- 0123
- 1234
```

And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve whatever you get.
