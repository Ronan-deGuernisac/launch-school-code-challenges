### Robot Name

---

Write a program that manages robot factory settings.

When robots come off the factory floor, they have no name.The first time you boot them up, a random name is generated, such as RX837 or BC811.

Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings, which means that their name gets wiped. The next time you ask, it will respond with a new random name.

The names must be random: they should not follow a predictable sequence. Random names means a risk of collisions. Your solution should not allow the use of the same name twice when avoidable.
